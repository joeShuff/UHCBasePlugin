# UHCBasePlugin
UHCBase is a plugin for Spigot Minecraft servers to control a game of UHC (Ultra Hardcore).

# Installation
Download the latest version for your minecraft version from the releases section. When later versions of Minecraft release, I will begin further development in that version only, so any bugs won't be fixed for older versions of Minecraft.

Current Version
[AWAITING TESTING FOR FIRST BUILD]

# Playing Instructions
At the absolute minimum, there are 2 commands that need to be ran to start your UHC.

`\prepuhc <worldborder diameter>` 
This command will do all the world preparation it needs and then spread the players/teams out randomly in the world. (See config for instructions for teams/solo spreading)

`/start-uhc`
This command kicks it all off, a countdown of 10 seconds will be following by the Ender Dragons roar kicking off the UHC.

# Terminology
Throughout the description of how to use this plugin I will use some concepts that could be interpreted in a few ways. This defines the way **this** plugin understands these concepts to hopefully clear up any confusion.

### Episode

### Perma Day

### Grace Period

### Apple Rate

### Ender Pearl Rate

# Config Setup
It is **strongly** advised that you take a look through all the config files before you run a UHC to make sure the settings will be right for you.

| `nether-enabled`     | `config.yml` | `true`                    | This sets whether the nether can be travelled to or not.
